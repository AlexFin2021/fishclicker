        How to play:
    </h1>
    <p>
        Press "f" to cast your fishing hook.  Then use "r" to try to keep your fishing lure from not being on top of the fish.  
        Fish can be worth a lot of money and there are many rare one which can be a giant boost to progression.  
        You can also buy buildings to the side that give passive money.  Then there are upgrades which buff many things such as lure size and bulding output.
        Use "up" and "down" arrow keys to scroll through the buidlings and use "left" and "right" arrow keys to go through upgrades.
